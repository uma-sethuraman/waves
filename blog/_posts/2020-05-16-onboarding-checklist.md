Feel free to drop a line to me at [m.more500@gmail.com](mailto:m.more500@gmail.com) with any questions or issues.  We will also assign you an initial mentor who will contact you soon.

## Onboarding Surveys

We put together a Google Form to collect information that will be used coordinate the workshop and assess its effectiveness.
We included several demographic questions in this survey.
Demographic information is collected to assess the diversity and equity of our the workshop and report anonymized information to funders.
You are not required to answer any demographics questions.

:soon: Fill out our onboarding survey [here](https://mmore500.com/hopto/aq).

Please try to keep weekdays from 1pm to 4pm EST clear on you calendars so that we can schedule whole group meetings.
It will be challenging to adjust schedules for individual participants, but we understand if you need to miss an occasional meeting.

:soon: If you do have a critical obligation that falls between 1pm and 4pm EST on weekdays and cannot be rescheduled, please fill out [this WhenIsGood](https://mmore500.com/hopto/as) to let us know.
Briefly describe your obligation in the comment.
Otherwise, there's no need to fill out this WhenIsGood.

Michgan State University requests that we refer undergraduate students working in summer positions to the Undergraduate Research Office.
They collect information that allows them to assess undergraduate research across the institution and to coordinate professional development activities.

Enter "BEACON" for "Research Type / Program Name."

## Tax Information

:bangbang:
*We are not lawyers or tax professionals!*
*This advice is general in nature and not to be taken as personal professional advice.*

*Thanks to [@alackles](https://github.com/alackles) for contributing the following section.*


State and federal income tax is NOT likely being withheld from these stipends.
(If you live in East Lansing there local income tax may also apply.)
This means you will likely need to self-withhold taxes.

This is a complex and annoying process; I've had to do it several times, so I'm here to help if you need any info or guidance.

I've attached below a guideline for state and federal taxes.
It's important to note that you'll pay state taxes for the state in which you are currently living not where payment is happening (Michigan).
It's also important to note you only pay taxes on amounts you make over the standard deduction/personal exemption, both federally and at state level.
Yeah, it's a whole thing.

Note that if this is your only paid gig this year you might not have to withhold federal taxes but may have to withold state taxes.
Note also that there are some situations where there isn't a penalty for not paying estimated taxes.
In particular, if you didn't earn enough money last year to owe any taxes, you're probably okay (but double check your exact situation).
Also important is there's probably no penalty if you pay <$1,000 in tax, which would be true if this is your only taxable income where it's not automatically withheld.
However, you WILL still have to pay this tax at the end of the year; you just don't have to pay it quarterly.

The IRS page on estimated taxes is [here](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/estimated-taxes).
Federal tax brackets for 2020 can be found [here](https://taxfoundation.org/2020-tax-brackets/).
State tax brackets for 2020 can be found [here](https://taxfoundation.org/state-individual-income-tax-rates-and-brackets-for-2020/).

:shrug:
I'm so sorry that you all have to deal with this and that we don't live in a country where this is all automatically calculated for you.
Like I said, I'm more than happy to help out with this if you haven't done this before or if you just have questions.

## Workshop Resources

We have assembled a listing of web resources related to the workshop [elsewhere on the site]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources.html).
If you would feel more comfortable brushing up on your C++ or evolution background before the workshop gets underway, feel free to click over there and check some of them out.
If you have ideas for what you'd like to see on there, feel free to [open a PR](https://github.com/mmore500/waves) or shoot me a message!

## Next Steps

:soon: If you haven't marked your calendars for our first orientation meeting, be sure to do so!
It will take place Tuesday, May 26 from 1pm to 4pm in the WAVES Zoom room.

We assigned initial mentors to participants based on match between mentors' projects and applicants' statements and resumes.
These assignments may shift as participants choose which projects interest them most, but they should at least be a good start.
Keep an eye out for an email from them in the next few days!

Once more, welcome to WAVES!
We're all really looking forward to getting to work with you.
