Like all good things, this year's WAVES workshop has come to a close.
It's been a packed ten weeks of software development, one-on-one mentorship, enriching enrichment seminars, and lively group get-togethers.

As we bid each other farewell and start our next chapters, we got together for a last time today to celebrate everyone's hard work & achievement over the course of the workshop.
We invited participants and mentors to submit gifs or memes that they felt represented their WAVES experience ahead of time.
I threw them in a slide show and had everyone give a thirty second-ish explanation of their image & say anything else they wanted to to the group --- followed, of course, by a hearty round of poetry-slam style snaps!

(This format actually worked surprisingly well --- much better than the other formats of virtual socials we had tried out.
I'd recommend giving something like this a go for anyone facilitating a virtual group or classroom this fall!)

Here's a recap of some of the wholesome fun.
